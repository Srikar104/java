 Current Project:
 I worked on Client transfer application (CTA) which is an intranet application, which used to facilitate various kinds of money transfer transactions that are ACH, Cheques, Wires, Journals. We designed our UI on single page application using Angular and we have separate screens for each type of money transfer transactions that our field officers, financial advisors, bank specialists can use. In backend we have micro-services for all different kind of transactions and they are hosted on cloud.We used Rest API to populate the transactional details and then display it to the officers who are assigned to it. We used AWS, Relational DB which are sequel server DB instances. We ..also have Redis cache in front of all our DBs which handle all our read operations. We have separate DB instances for all read and write operations. And all the microservices which are hosted on AWS are hosted on auto scaling group, each microservices have their own scaling policies which are auto scaling group policies (JSON policies) to scale in and scale out instances. We used Kubernetes for the code deployment and Sonarqube for code review.
